# What is the idea
- MahsaNG is client-side of project [Segaro_Dream](https://github.com/GFW-knocker/Segaro_Dream)
- MahsaNG is a decentralized public platform in which everyone can share their configs to help others
- Donated configs continuously monitored and redistributed to users based on clients feedback in each subnet-ip
- Our goal is to make a superior vpn platform which is free,stable,scalable,distributed & filter-resistant

# Difference to v2rayNG
- vpn providers can use ADS service to make income instead of direct sell
- everyone can share their unused vps bandwidth to help others
- prevent free configs to be stolen and reselled
- Automatic report for refining config collection at central servers
- DNS over HTTPS
- TLS Fragmentor
- HTTP & WS fake Host
- Rotating Configs
- Random Subdomain
- & much more ...

# build from source
- some parts of source used for encrypting config is closed to prevent leakage & thus reselling of donated configs
- all other technology used to bypass filtering is willingly published including but not limited to Youtube Direct , TLS & HTTPS & DoH fragmentor & fake Host

# build V2rayNG from source
- you need to place libv2ray.aar in v2rayng/apps/libs folder
- you can compile it yourself from [AndroidLibXrayLite](https://github.com/2dust/AndroidLibXrayLite) after installing Go & Go mobile
- or you can download v1.5 from [here](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayNG/blob/09d854dc784365e5499e444aff065055adcc5105/V2rayNG/app/libs/libv2ray.aar)
- or submit a issue and i provide libv2ray.aar v1.8.3
